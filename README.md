# Work Day Scheduler

## Short description

The objective of this project is to create a simple work day Scheduler. The scheduler will allow the user to save events for each hour of the day by entering in text to the relevant fields on the webpage. From there this information will be saved to storage and presented to the user on refresh of the page.

The code itself utilises both moment.js(for accurate date/times) and also jQuery.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

The website/app will load and function as intended. The ways in which it should work are as follows:

- Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner

- Displays the current time in the Jumbotron

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock

- Persist events between refreshes of a page

### Screenshot of completed site

The following image shows the web applications finished appearance
